IDEAS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

* Include functions for calculating appropriate heading, tilt, and roll given
  points representing the position of an aircraft

* Create function so objects can generate their own <Change>, etc. eleements
  for an AnimatedUpdate

* Improve helper functions, their tests, and their documentation

* Add functions to generate various shapes in one and possibly two dimensions,
  and other functions to accept those paths as arguments to create flythroughs.
  These paths could include regular lines, lines where the points expand or
  contract geometrically or exponentially, sine and cosine functions (for
  making circles), etc., and other functions could take these paths as
  arguments to describe latitude, longitude, altitude, duration, heading, tilt,
  etc. For instance, a sine path passed to the tilt parameter would rock back
  and forth. sine and cosine passed to lat and long respectivally would travel
  in a circle. Adding an exponentially increasing range path would make it a
  spiral.

* Change methods and functions so options are accepted as a hash, rather than
  in some arbitrary order I have to keep looking up in the docs

* Add a function to get the current camera position, where possible

* Add tests which check if generated xml is valid due to the DTD

* Enable running Kamelopard on Ruby 1.9. Currently it works only on 1.8 while
  on 1.9 many test fail.
