= kameleopard: Ruby gem to simplify production of KML

This gem simplifies generating KML files, such as those used by Google Earth

== Requirements

It's probably best to use a fairly non-prehistoric verion of Ruby, as that's
what's most frequently tested.

== Installation

Install via RubyGems:

  gem install kameleopard

The hard way (this may have been superseded by something better, and no one
updated the docs):

  gem build kameleopard.gemspec
  gem install kameleopard-0.0.1.gem    <-- Note the version number may change without warning
